CSX Puzzle Solver, Project Part 2:  Water & Clock

Name: Derrick Lee


1. Explain how your common solver is able to work with both puzzles.
    Solver uses the calls methods contained in the Puzzle interface, thus allowing the methods
    to be defined in each of the other classes (Clock and Water) and have different operations.


2. What was the type of configuration you used for each puzzle?
    For the Clock puzzle, the subconfiguration was a Clock object that held a single integer. 
    The final configs were ArrayLists of these subconfigurations.
    
    For the Water puzzle, the subconfiguration was a Water object that held an array of integers.
    Final configs were ArrayLists of these subconfigurations.


3. Starting with the Puzzle interface from part 1, what were the major
changes and additions you had to make?
    The subconfigurations had to be more generic so they were stored in separate Puzzle objects.
    Modified the BFS so that subconfigurations would not be repeated (required a HashSet).



4. What problems, if any, did you encounter when re-designing your 
project from part 1?
    Ensuring that none of the subconfigurations repeated.
